    "CityLearn ([Nweye et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.03848)) is an open-source Gymnasium environment for the easy implementation and benchmarking of rule-based control (RBC), reinforcement learning control (RLC), and model-predictive control (MPC) algorithms for distributed energy resources (DERs) in a demand response (DR) setting. CityLearn is used to reshape the aggregated electricity load profile by controlling DERs in a district of diverse\n",
    "buildings, and allows for multi-agent control and district-level key performance indicators (KPIs) evaluation. First developed by [Vazquez-Canteli et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3360322.3360998), it has been [applied\n",
    "extensively for DER control benchmarking in scenarios of\n",

    "\n",
    "CityLearn is used in [The CityLearn Challenge](https://www.citylearn.net/citylearn_challenge/index.html) which is an opportunity to compete in investigating the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed control systems to tackle multiple problems in the built-environment. It attracts a multidisciplinary audience including researchers, industry experts, sustainability enthusiasts and AI hobbyists as a means of crowd-sourcing solutions to these multiple problems."

    "CityLearn models a district of buildings with similar or different loads, electric devices, energy storage systems (ESSs) and electricity sources that satisfy the loads as shown in the figure above. There is no upper limit on the number of buildings in a district and a district can have as few as one building.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are up to five loads in a building including space cooling, space heating domestic hot water (DHW) heating, electric equipment, and electric (EV) loads. The space cooling and heating loads refer to the energy needed to maintain the indoor\n",
    "dry-bulb temperature at its setpoint. A building in CityLearn is modeled as a single thermal zone where space thermal loads affect its indoor dry-bulb temperature. It uses an long-short-term memory regression model to approximate its thermal dynamics that quantifies the effect of the thermal load on temperature. Then, an occupant model has the ability to override the temperature setpoint. The DHW heating load is the total heating energy needed to satisfy hot water end-uses such as shower, bathroom, and kitchen sinks, and other water end uses requiring water heating that are not space heating-related. Electric equipment refer to non-shiftable plug loads such as lighting, entertainment and kitchen appliances. The EV load is the energy required to charge an EV to a scheduled departure state-of-charge (SoC).\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all loads need to exist in a building e.g., a building situated in a heating dominant climate may not have cooling loads year-round. Also, anyone or all of these loads are either known a priori from building energy performance\n",
    "simulation (BEPS) or real-world measurement. In these instances, the ideal load must be satisfied. Alternatively, they are controlled loads and are inferred at runtime e.g., heat pump power control drives space cooling or heating loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "To satisfy these loads in either the ideal or control-action case, CityLearn makes use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems directly or ESSs through load shifting. The `cooling_device`, `heating_device`, and `dhw_device` are HVAC electric device objects in CityLearn that are used to satisfy the space cooling, space heating and DHW heating loads respectively. The `cooling_device` is a heat pump while the `heating_device` and `dhw_device` are either heat pump or electric heater type. These HVAC systems may be used to charge thermal energy storage (TES) systems in the building.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are up to five optional and controlled ESSs in a building including `cooling_storage`, `heating_storage`, `dhw_storage`, `electrical_storage`, and `electric_vehicle` ESS objects. The `cooling_storage`, `heating_storage`, and `dhw_storage` are thermal energy storage (TES) DER type and provide space cooling, space heating and DHW heating load shifting flexibility respectively. They are charged by the HVAC device used to meet the thermal load which they service e.g. is the cooling_device charging the `cooling_storage`. The `electrical_storage` is a battery energy storage system (BESS) DER type that powers any of the aforementioned electric devices when in discharge mode or is powered by one or more of the electricity sources. The `electric_vehicle` is an EV DER type and performs similar function as the `electrical_storage`, however, the EV is available on a schedule defined by its arrival and departure\n",
    "times. The EV can be used in three modes: grid-to-vehicle (G2V), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and no control (i.e., where the EV acts as a load without any possible control over its charging).\n",
    "\n",
    "The electric devices are primarily powered by the electric grid. CityLearn at the time of writing, does not include a grid model so the power a building is able to draw from the grid at a given time step is unconstrained, except in the\n",
    "case of a power outage. Optionally, a building may have a photovoltaic (PV) system that provides self-generation as a first source of electricity before the grid. The optional `electrical_storage` and `electric_vehicle` are charged by the grid and PV but also augment the electricity supply when in discharge mode to supply the building with electricity. Excess self-generation, `electrical_storage`, and `electric_vehicle` discharge are sent to the grid as part of the building's net export.\n"

    "There are three possible control configurations in CityLearn namely; single-agent, independent multi-agent, and coordinated multi-agent as shown in the figure above. In the single-agent configuration, there is a one-to-many relationship between the control agent and buildings where a centralized agent collects observations and prescribes actions for all DERs in the district and, receives a single reward value each time step to learn a generalized control policy. This is akin to an energy aggregator controlling flexible resources in a distributed manner. The independent multi-agent configuration has a one-to-one agent-building relationship thus, there are as many rewards as buildings each time step and a unique control policy is learned for each building. The coordinated multi-agent configuration is similar to the independent multi-agent configuration except that agents can share information to achieve cooperative objectives e.g. district peak reduction or competitive objectives e.g. price bidding in the energy flexibility market.\n",

In RBC, the reward is not utilized while in MPC, the reward is akin to the control objective. Also, RBC policy is static and does not consider the observations\n",
