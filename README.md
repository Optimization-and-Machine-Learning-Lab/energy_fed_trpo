## Dataset
- Generate demand and solar generation with functions of temperature and humidity
`CityLearn/citylearn/generate_weather_building.py`

- Visualize the demand and solar data
`CityLearn/citylearn/data/my_data/banma.ipynb`

## Train and test

- Train and test on generator
`TRPO/main_fl_gen.py`

- Train and test on testing data
`TRPO/main_baseline_1b.py`

- One agent for one building, train with training data, test with testing data
`TRPO/main_fl_baseline_1b.py`

- FRL, train with training data, test with testing data
`TRPO/main_fl.py`

## Environments
- My simple environment: 
  files startng with `my` in `Citylearn.citylearn`. Generate non_shiftable_load and solar_generation from fixed temperature and humitdity. Training and testing have same pattern but no overlap. Data is generated by `CityLearn/citylearn/generate_weather_building.py`.

- Martin's generator: 
files startng with `gen` in `Citylearn.citylearn`. Generate non_shiftable_load and solar_generation with same pattern and random baseline. Pass the random value and generate one-day data.
